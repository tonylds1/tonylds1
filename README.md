### Hello Guys! Welcome to my profile

I am from Brazil, Paraiba, Joao Pessoa. Most of my experience is with PHP (it has evolved a lot, believe-me), but I also work with Java, Python and C++. The last language I begun to learn (and I am still learning) is Go. Hope to have something better to write soon. 
Beyond code, I love the Agile World. Scrum broght to my life a better way to put my talents to work.
